# Project Context

You are working on the LeadPoet subnet, a Bittensor-based decentralized lead generation network:
- **Purpose**: Miners source high-quality prospects into a Prospect Pool; validators verify their legitimacy; miners curate prospects based on buyer ICP criteria; validators score curated prospects for clients.
- **Tech Stack**: Bittensor (Python, for miners/validators), Supabase (for Prospect Pool storage), FastAPI (for buyer-facing API), ML models (e.g., XGBoost for validation, inference for scoring).
- **Workflow**:
  1. Miners source prospects and submit to validators.
  2. Validators perform legitimacy audits (format, contact legitimacy, compliance, duplicates) and add valid prospects to the Prospect Pool (Supabase).
  3. Buyers submit ICP queries via API; miners curate prospect lists from the pool.
  4. Validators score curated prospects using a conversion model; the top 10 prospects (C > 0.1) are sent to the buyer.
  5. Buyer feedback updates prospect Conversion Scores (C) via CRM integrations.
- **Data Model**:
  - `prospects` table: Stores pool prospects (fields: Business, Owner Full name, First, Last, Owner(s) Email, LinkedIn, Website, Industry, Region, Source, Conversion_Score).
  - `queries` table: Tracks buyer ICP queries (fields: query_id, buyer_hotkey, industry, region, status).
  - `curated_lists` table: Stores miner-curated lists (fields: query_id, miner_uid, prospect_ids, submission_timestamp).
  - `scores` table: Stores validator-assigned Conversion Scores (fields: query_id, prospect_id, conversion_score, validator_hotkey).
- **Incentives**:
  - Miners earn emissions based on Sourcing Score (Sₘ, 40%) and Curating Score (Kₘ, 60%).
  - Validators earn emissions based on validation accuracy and reputation.
- **Authentication**: Bittensor wallet-based authentication for miners/validators; API keys for buyers.
- **UX Flow**: Buyer submits ICP query → API triggers miner curation → Validators score prospects → Buyer receives curated list → Feedback via CRM.
