# Database Schema Standards

- Section `## 4. Database Schema` must list each table as `- **table_name**:`.
- Under each table:
  - Use sublist `- Columns:` with bullet items specifying name, type, constraints.
  - Include `- Indexes:` sublist.
  - Include `- Security:` sublist (e.g., RLS, encryption).
