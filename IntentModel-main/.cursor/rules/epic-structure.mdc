# Epic Structure

1. Each epic begins with a `### Epic X: [Title]` heading.
2. Next line must be **Goal:** followed by a concise statement.
3. Include a table with columns: `Story ID`, `User Story`, `Acceptance Criteria`.
4. After the table, add an **Acceptance Criteria:** bullet list.
5. Conclude with a **Tasks:** numbered list.
