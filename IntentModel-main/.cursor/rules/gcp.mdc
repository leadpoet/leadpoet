description: Ensure resilient Fire Enrich calls with retry and dead-letter handling.

### Rule
All enrichment client code **must**:
1. Retry on HTTP 429 or 5xx with exponential back-off, max 5 attempts.
2. After final failure, write the original record to `dead_letter/enrich_fail.jsonl`.
3. Log retries and failures with reason code.
