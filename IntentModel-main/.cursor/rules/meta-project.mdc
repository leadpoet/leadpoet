# Project Context

You are working on Leadpoet.com’s MVP:
- **Tech Stack:** Supabase (Auth, Database, Realtime), Google Cloud Functions (Node.js/TypeScript), React (Vite or Next.js), TailwindCSS.
- **Workflow:** Frontend submits queries → writes to Supabase → triggers GCF → writes lead results back to Supabase.
- **Data Model:** `filter_options`, `queries`, `leads` tables.
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth (no email verification).
- **UX Flow:** Login → Dashboard with filters → Submit → History view with status → CSV download.
