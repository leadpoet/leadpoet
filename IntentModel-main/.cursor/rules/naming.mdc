# Folder Naming & Structure

- Use kebab-case for folder names: `components/history-view`, `lib/db-client`.
- Group by domain:
  - `components/` for React UI components.
  - `lib/` for utility modules (Supabase client, CSV helpers).
  - `pages/` or `app/` for route-level code.
  - `types/` for shared TypeScript interfaces.
- Keep modules self‑contained; avoid cross‑folder dependencies.
