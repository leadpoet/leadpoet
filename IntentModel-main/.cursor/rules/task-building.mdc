description: Ensure tasks.md mirrors BRD epics, tasks, sub-tasks, and maps each §5 function and §10 metric.

### Rule
When ChatGPT generates **tasks.md**:
1. Create one epic per BRD §5 functional subsection:
   - Scraping Engine
   - Pre-Enrich Legitimacy Check
   - Enrichment Module
   - Submission Stub
   - Monitoring and Logging
2. Under each epic, list tasks with check-box sub-steps and:
   - output artifact path
   - estimated hours (int)
   - owner placeholder "@TODO"
3. Verify every BRD success metric appears as at least one acceptance criterion.
