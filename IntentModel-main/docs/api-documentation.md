## SDKs and Libraries

### Python

```bash
pip install leadpoet-client
```

```python
from leadpoet import LeadpoetClient

client = LeadpoetClient(api_key="your_api_key")

# Query leads
response = client.query_leads(
    query="Find companies looking for CRM software",
    limit=25,
    filters={
        "industries": ["technology"],
        "company_size": ["51-200"]
    }
)

print(f"Found {len(response.leads)} leads")
for lead in response.leads:
    print(f"{lead.company_name} - {lead.score}")
```

### JavaScript/Node.js

```bash
npm install @leadpoet/client
```

```javascript
const { LeadpoetClient } = require('@leadpoet/client');

const client = new LeadpoetClient('your_api_key');

// Query leads
const response = await client.queryLeads({
  query: 'Find companies looking for CRM software',
  limit: 25,
  filters: {
    industries: ['technology'],
    companySize: ['51-200']
  }
});

console.log(`Found ${response.leads.length} leads`);
response.leads.forEach(lead => {
  console.log(`${lead.companyName} - ${lead.score}`);
});
```

### cURL Examples

#### Basic Query

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.leadpoet.com/query" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "Find companies looking for CRM software",
    "limit": 25
  }'
```

#### Query with Filters

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.leadpoet.com/query" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "Find technology companies in San Francisco looking for marketing automation",
    "limit": 50,
    "filters": {
      "industries": ["technology"],
      "location": "San Francisco",
      "company_size": ["51-200", "201-1000"],
      "technologies": ["hubspot", "marketo"]
    }
  }'
```

## Performance Guidelines

### Best Practices

1. **Specific Queries**: Use specific, detailed queries for better results
2. **Appropriate Limits**: Start with smaller limits (25-50) and increase as needed
3. **Use Filters**: Leverage filters to reduce noise and improve relevance
4. **Monitor Costs**: Track cost per lead to stay within budget
5. **Cache Results**: Implement client-side caching for repeated queries

### Query Examples

#### Good Queries
- "Find SaaS companies with 50-200 employees looking for customer support software"
- "Identify healthcare companies in Boston seeking electronic health records systems"
- "Find manufacturing companies using legacy ERP systems that need modernization"

#### Poor Queries
- "Find companies" (too vague)
- "CRM" (too short)
- "All businesses" (too broad)

## Rate Limiting and Throttling

### Rate Limits
- **Standard**: 100 requests/minute
- **Burst**: 1000 requests/minute
- **Daily**: 10,000 requests/day

### Cost Limits
- **Per Lead**: $0.002 maximum (automatically enforced)
- **Per Query**: $4.00 maximum (2000 leads)
- **Daily**: $100 maximum

### Throttling
The API may throttle requests based on:
- Query quality reputation score
- Cost per lead efficiency
- Service load and capacity

### Rate Limit Headers
When approaching rate limits, the API includes the following headers:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests allowed in the window
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Number of requests remaining in the current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time when the rate limit window resets (Unix timestamp)

### Handling Rate Limits
When you receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response:
1. **Wait for the reset time** indicated in the `X-RateLimit-Reset` header
2. **Implement exponential backoff** for retry attempts
3. **Consider reducing request frequency** or implementing caching
4. **Monitor your usage** to stay within limits
