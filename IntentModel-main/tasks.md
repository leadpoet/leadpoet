# Leadpoet Intent Model v1.1 Implementation Tasks

## Project Overview
Leadpoet must return the **K** leads most likely to purchase any B2B product specified in a free-text prompt. The v1.1 hybrid cascade must achieve < **400 ms** P95 latency at â‰¤ **$0.002** COGS per lead under 250 QPS load, introduce cold-start ranking tricks, and harden miner incentives over a six-week roadmap.

## Success Criteria
- All Functional Requirements **F-1 â€¦ F-10** implemented and passing tests.
- P95 latency < 400 ms, P99 < 550 ms; average cost â‰¤ $0.002; P99 cost â‰¤ $0.004.
- Precision@25 â‰¥ 30 % by Week 8; LLM call ratio â‰¤ 30 %.
- Miner incentive module live with quality-weighted emissions and anti-spam protections.
- Complete roadmap milestones **W0 â€“ W6** on time.
